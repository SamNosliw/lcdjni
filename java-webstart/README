Java WebStart Example
---------------------

This example shows how a LCDJNI application can be deployed using Java
Web Start.  Java Web Start allows applications to be installed and run
with a single click (-ish) from the web.

Deployment
----------

Edit 'codebase' attribute of the lcdhelloworld.jnlp file to the
address of your website.

Compile the example by running 'ant' from the checkout directory of
lcdjni.  The output files will be written to
<checkout-directory>/java-webstart/build/out.

Copy all of these files to your website.

Configure your website to serve the '.jnlp' files with the
'application/x-java-jnlp-file' MIME type.  Eg for Apache, use the
AddType directive in your .htaccess file.

Browsing to the website location should show a button which when
clicked downloads and runs the example.  The example will just pop up
a red screen on your keyboard, which will exit after a few seconds.

WebStart should automatically run either the 32-bit or 64-bit
application.

Note that webstart applications must be signed.  The ant script will
create a one-off self-signed key to sign the applications with.  You
may want to use a better managed keystore.
