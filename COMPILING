Building the JAR
----------------

The JAR file can be built using ant by typing:

  ant


Building the DLLs
-----------------

The DLLs can be built with either Visual C++ 2008 Express, or the
Microsoft Windows SDK Version 7.0.

By default the Visual C++ 2008 Express is only capable of building the
32-bit version of the DLL.

The build files make the following assumptions:

  a. That the Logitech SDK has been unzipped to:

C:\Program Files\Logitech\GamePanel Software\LCD Manager\SDK\LCDSDK_3.04.143

  b. That the 64-bit JDK 1.6 has been installed to c:\jdk

  c. That the 32-bit JDK 1.6 has been installed to c:\jdk32

You may need to edit the build files as appropriate.


To build the DLL using the Windows SDK:

  1. Start the Windows SDK "CMD Shell" from the start menu.
  2. cd <project-dir>\lcdjni\c\lcdjni-c
  3. Create the 32-bit DLL with:
       msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=Win32
  4. Create the 64-bit DLL with:
       msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
