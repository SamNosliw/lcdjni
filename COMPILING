Prerequisites
-------------

"JDK 6" is required to build the Java components.

"Apache Ant" must be installed to run the build scripts.

The C++ components were developed using "Visual C++ 2008 Express".

"Windows SDK Version 7.0" is required to build the C++ components.

By default, Visual C++ 2008 Express is only capable of building the
32-bit version of the DLL, but the Windows SDK also includes the
64-bit compiler.


The build files make the following assumptions:

  a. That the Logitech SDK has been unzipped to:

     C:\Program Files\Logitech\GamePanel Software\LCD Manager\SDK\LCDSDK_3.04.143

  b. That the 64-bit JDK 1.6 has been installed to c:\jdk

  c. That the 32-bit JDK 1.6 has been installed to c:\jdk32


The Visual C++ project configuration may require editing if the environment is different.


Compilation
-----------

To build the JAR files, examples, and C++ DLL:

  1. Start the Windows SDK "CMD Shell" from the start menu.
  2. cd <project-dir>
  3. Type ant


If you are having problems building the 64-bit DLL, you can skip it by
running:

  1. Start the Windows SDK "CMD Shell" from the start menu.
  2. cd <project-dir>
  3. Type ant -Dskip-64=true


If you don't have Visual C++ or the Windows SDK installed, you can
just build the Java components by running:

  1. Start a command prompt
  2. cd <project-dir>
  3. Type ant -Dskip-64=true -Dskip-32=true

You can also skip building the webstart example, by adding the parameter:

    -Dskip-webstart=true
